## Hi, IÂ´m DekiNa.

I'm a student (Currently learning programming) that found out technology and the internet at a very young age, and got obssesed with that.

- A Front-End enjoyer
- Pretty young still
- Likes to know why things work the way they do
- Also likes learning overall

My "skills" shine the most in JS, React, TS, HTML, CSS, and simiar stuff.

`Hopefully we can learn about each other, it'd be a pleasure.`
